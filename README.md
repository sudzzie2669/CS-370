Project Summary
In this project, I developed an intelligent pirate agent capable of solving a treasure-hunting game using reinforcement learning. The agent was trained using a deep Q-learning algorithm implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The maze environment simulates different obstacles and starting points, requiring the agent to learn optimal navigation strategies over time.

I was provided with starter code that included the game environment (in TreasureMaze.py), the experience replay system (in GameExperience.py), and a basic training structure. I was responsible for writing the Q-training algorithm inside the notebook, implementing the learning loop, and applying a deep neural network model to teach the pirate agent to find the treasure successfully. I also handled training hyperparameters, state observation, experience memory, and completion criteria.

Connection to Computer Science Concepts
This project helped me apply core concepts from artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning and neural networks. I gained hands-on experience with techniques like Q-learning, exploration vs. exploitation strategies, reward-based learning, and model training using Keras.

Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing and implementing efficient, scalable, and reliable solutions. In this case, I approached the problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable components—understanding the environment, modeling the agent's decisions, and iteratively improving performance through training and feedback.

Ethical Considerations
As a computer scientist, I recognize that my work can directly impact users and organizations. In projects involving AI, ethical responsibilities include ensuring fairness in decision-making, transparency in how algorithms operate, and protecting user data. For this project, although it was a game simulation, the same principles apply—building agents that behave predictably and evaluating models thoroughly to prevent unintended consequences in real-world systems.
